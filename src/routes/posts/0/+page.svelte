<h1>Introduction <i>[2023-05-02]</i></h1>
<p>
    Under the newly created psuedonym <i>neozxw</i>, I am the sole operator and developer of the neozxw platform. 
    This network was created in order to display, connect, and expand my web projects.
    It also serves as a means of communication, if desired.
</p>
<h2>A new life</h2>
<p>
    I've chosen to obfuscate parts of my personal identity and former accounts, as of the time being.
    The medium of social networking is no longer fit for my route in life, and actually serves to be <i>counter-productive.</i>
</p>
<p>
    I intend to directly focus on what I truly have passion in, grow my projects, and eventually polish my portfolio to a professional level.
    However, instead of prioritizing my attention to match my long-term plans, I would misuse time scrolling through the internet and engaging in insignificant drama.
</p>
<p>
    Not only was my development impacted, my mental state also declined; engaging in the online world shaped my brain negatively.
    By natural forces, the internet reduces attention span and the quality of information, to the point that the surrounding world is engineered to drive one's mind into an echo chamber of rage.
</p>
<p>
    This is not what I want for myself, so I will take the needed actions to counteract it.
</p>
<h2>However...</h2>
<p>
    For a few exclusive purposes that would be significantly assisted by the presence of social media, such as marketing or generating publicity, I will operate accounts.
    These identities will be connected to a <i>brand</i>, rather than a personality.
