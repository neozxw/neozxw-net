<h1>A Revised New Life <i>[2023-05-03]</i></h1>
<p>
    I have reviewed my previous decision, coming to the conclusion that it is extreme to abolish social media from my life entirely.
    While my initial intention was to dedicate the majority of my downtime to developing projects, a new root issue arised: <b>burnout</b>. 
</p>
<p>
    For now, it is physically impossible for me to continously develop a project while neglecting breaks or entertainment.
    My personal observations seem to conclude that I always fall back into the older days, times that should've been left behind.
</p>
<h2>Addressing a Paradox</h2>
<p>
    This results in a self-contradicting situation: I hate social media and want it out of my life, but I keep returning to it.
    In order to fix my dilemna, I will simply change the way I use social media.
</p>
<p>
    Rather than doomscrolling, social media can be implemented to broadcast my hobbies, and meet constructive members of society.
    I'm assuming this is the intent of Web 2.0, it is unfortunate how it devolved into a toxic distraction that I don't want to touch.
</p>
<h2>What happens to the web log?</h2>
<p>
    It will be reserved for important updates or project news that I feel cannot be expressed through a simple post.
